# Berlin's LOR structure ('Lebensweltlich Orientierte R채ume') as Linked Open Data

The 'Lebensweltlich orientierten R채ume', or LOR, is a system that divides the city of Berlin into a hierarchy of continuously smaller geographical units. 
At the top are the 12 Bezirke (burroughs).
The Bezirke are divided into 58 Prognoser채ume, which are further divided into 143 Bezirksregionen.
Finally, at the lowest level, there are 542 Planungsr채ume.
The LORs are the basis for planning, prognosis and monitoring of demographic and social developments in Berlin. 

This dataset is a conversion of the existing WFS-services to Linked Data, or RDF.

The data is converted using a series of scripts and tools, all orchestrated by the [Makefile](Makefile).

It is then published as Linked Open Data using the [LOD Site Generator](https://github.com/berlinonline/lod-sg) repository as a template.
